## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- useAxios Hook
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) / [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) Mapping APIs
- [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/)

### What I learned

Be careful while developing with APIs which limit your access via credits -- one small mistake in your REST calls could burn through your credits!

### Continued development

Need to continue work on my API interactions. Still searching for better ways to call APIs in React -- besides `useEffect` blocks which seem to get me stuck in recursive loops that burn through my API credits!
